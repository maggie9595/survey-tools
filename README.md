My project is similar to the Cooper.com comparison of prototyping tools, but for comparing survey tools instead. The website is aimed at college students and therefore focus on the survey toolâ€™s price, ease of use, distribution tools, analysis tools, etc. The project can be viewed by opening the index.html file.
